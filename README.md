# projbyzuri
Hey I'm Zuri! This is where I'll be keeping all of my projects, and where I will document my progress and journey through comp sci! I'm also trying to get a website up, hence the work in progress. I'm also trying to make it look a little cooler so it's only boring looking right now. enjoy! 

**zuri's project website for jobs (in progress!!)**
***

-- *project summaries* --


my projects are held in folders, here are what the names mean and what each project does

**finalcodingprog** - uses a search engine to prompt the user for a song, album, or artist, then pulls from spotify a link to the song, track, or artist

**searchproj** - created a simple search engine to comb through wikipedia pages and pull out a specific one based on criteria and keyword/s provided by the user

**thatdog** - image manipulation - messed with the rgb values of the individual pixels of an image of a dog to make a couple of diy filters.
